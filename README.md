## ["Frameworks in Software Engineering"](https://gbksoft.com/blog/what-is-framework/)

As a student, learning the development of software, particularly in this very class, I often get confused regarding the various frameworks that are in place. Firstly, what frameworks should a person use, why do we need them, and a question arises that with the rapid developments, would we have to keep learning new frameworks?

This article definitely helps me understand the practicality of the frameworks that are in place. With the most popular and practical being React, Angular, and NodeJS, what these frameworks do is that they allow for the reusability of code and help avoid reinventing the wheel for things that are already done in a similar way. The examples used in this article definitely helped me develop a better understanding of the underlying need for these frameworks.

It is definitely true that we can choose not to use any such frameworks, but as the articles suggests, using them is the smarter approach since, in comparison to libraries, they allow for more control and understanding of the code and help us develop software considerably faster and with a personal touch much more easily.

It also helps me understand on why companies require Software Engineers to have prior knowledge or experience with such frameworks.

It is indeed very beneficial to spend time to learn the operation of a framework as in the long run it pays off; more work could be done in a shorter time with much better quality. However, it is also important to stay updated with the frameworks because some JavaScript frameworks become outdated very quickly requiring additional time and effort to deal with arising problems.
